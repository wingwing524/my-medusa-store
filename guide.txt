Given your stack (Medusa backend + Next.js storefront + images + custom domain) and your preference for nice DX, here’s what I’d recommend:

Recommended stack for you
Core recommendation:

Medusa + Postgres on Railway
Next.js storefront on Vercel
Images on Cloudflare R2
Domain from Cloudflare / Namecheap

This is essentially my earlier Option B, tuned to your preferences.
Rough monthly cost (for ~500 users/day)


Railway (Medusa backend + Postgres + traffic) → ≈ US$12–13 / month


Vercel (Next.js, Hobby) → US$0 (your 75k pageviews + bandwidth fit in free tier)


Cloudflare R2 (product images, ~5 GB storage, modest ops) → ≈ US$0.20 / month


Domain (.com, via Cloudflare / Namecheap etc.) → ≈ US$1–1.5 / month


👉 Total ballpark: ~US$14–15/month
(for a real, always-on shop with nice DX)
Not the absolute cheapest possible, but very good value for how easy it will be to manage.

How deployment will look in practice
1. Medusa backend on Railway


Repo


Put your Medusa backend in its own GitHub repo (or a monorepo, Railway can handle both).




Create service on Railway


“New Project” → “Deploy from GitHub” → pick your Medusa repo.


Select the appropriate start command (e.g. yarn start or medusa start).




Postgres


Add a Postgres plugin/service in the same Railway project.


Railway gives you a DATABASE_URL – plug that into Medusa’s env.




Env vars


Add things like:


DATABASE_URL


REDIS_URL (if you use Redis)


JWT_SECRET, COOKIE_SECRET


storage config (see next step)






Auto-deploy


Set the deploy trigger to “Auto deploy on push to main” (or your prod branch).


Done: every push → build → deploy.




2. Image storage on Cloudflare R2


Create an R2 bucket


e.g. myshop-images.




Set up public access


Either use R2’s public bucket URL or put it behind a custom domain (e.g. media.myshop.com) via Cloudflare DNS.




Configure Medusa file service


Use the S3-compatible API settings for R2:


R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID


R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY


R2_ENDPOINT (R2 S3 endpoint)


R2_BUCKET




Install/configure the corresponding Medusa file service (S3 adapter pointing to R2).




Result


Medusa will upload product images to R2.


Frontend just loads images from https://media.myshop.com/... (or the R2 public URL).




3. Next.js storefront on Vercel


Repo


Your storefront in a GitHub repo (can be the same monorepo as Medusa or separate).




Connect to Vercel


Import the repo on Vercel → it will auto-detect Next.js.




Env vars


Set:


NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL → the Railway Medusa URL (later, something like https://api.myshop.com)


Any other keys you need (e.g. Stripe publishable key).






Auto-deploy


Enable auto deploy on push for your main branch.


You’ll get preview deployments per branch automatically.





Domain wiring (example)
Assume you register myshop.com at Cloudflare:


Root / storefront


On Vercel, add a custom domain myshop.com.


Vercel will tell you what DNS records to set (either NS or A/CNAME).


Result: https://myshop.com → Next.js storefront.




API subdomain


On Railway, add a custom domain api.myshop.com in the project’s settings.


Railway gives you a CNAME target; set api.myshop.com → that CNAME in Cloudflare DNS.


Result: https://api.myshop.com → Medusa backend.




Media subdomain (images)


In Cloudflare, create media.myshop.com pointing to R2 (either via Cloudflare’s R2 custom domain feature or using a CNAME to the R2 hostname).


Result: https://media.myshop.com → Cloudflare R2 bucket.




Then in your code:


Medusa returns image URLs like https://media.myshop.com/products/xxx.jpg.


Next.js displays them; Vercel just proxies to the browser.



If you want even simpler (all-in Railway)
If you really want everything in one dashboard:


Host Medusa + Next.js both on Railway:


1 service for Medusa API (with Postgres plugin).


1 service for Next.js SSR app (or static build via a Node server).




Keep Cloudflare R2 for images.


Domain DNS:


myshop.com → Next.js service on Railway


api.myshop.com → Medusa service on Railway


media.myshop.com → R2




Cost will be a bit closer to the Render-type numbers (because you’re running two Node services 24/7 on Railway), but still reasonable. You lose Vercel’s very nice preview/deploy features, though.

If you tell me:


whether your Medusa & Next.js are in one repo or two, and


which variant you prefer (Railway+Vercel vs all Railway),


I can sketch the exact services you’d create on Railway + env vars list so you can literally follow and get it live.
